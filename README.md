A problem that exists in my community is water pressure.

I want to make an app that keeps track of the water pressure of Jackson which gives the residents ample time to get water for their homes. People are tired of turning on the news just to see they must boil their water again or just can’t even use their water. It’s a waste of gas just to get extra water for your home after you came back from driving to and from work.
